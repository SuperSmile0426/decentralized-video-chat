Decentralized video chat platform powered by WebRTC using Twilio STUN/TURN infrastructure.

# Quick start
* You will need to have Node.js installed, this project has been tested with Node version 10.X.X and 12.X.X but 
probably works with more versions
* Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ianramzy/decentralized-video-chat
cd decentralized-video-chat
```
* Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
* Start the server
```
npm start
```
* Open two browsers on your laptop and point them `localhost:3000`. 
* If you want to use a client on another computer, make sure you publish your server on an HTTPS connection.
 You can use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for that.
